# hello-world
This is the first repository in GitHub for manufercampos

My first work here in github is really exciting, because I am entering the Big Data realm.
I love data analysis and generating actions based on insights moves me deeply.
In my opinion I'm ment to do this kind of job.

So this changes basically add a little more information about my work in the readme file
Thanks for reading!
